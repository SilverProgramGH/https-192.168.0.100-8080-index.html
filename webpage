                <h2> BIG DREAM </h2>

                <h4> Become a web and game developer </h4>

                <p> I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics. After that I want to learn gamedesign and become the best gamedeveloper in the whole, entire world! I love to come up with ideas and make them happen, just for fun, and for money...maybe. I would love to design and program my games with my friends! </p>
